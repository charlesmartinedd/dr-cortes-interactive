    "bio": "Dr. Carlos E. Cortés is a pioneering figure in multicultural education, ethnic studies, and diversity scholarship with a career spanning seven decades. Born in 1934 in Kansas City, Missouri, he grew up navigating the intersection of cultures as the son of Carlos Cortés, a Mexican Catholic immigrant from Guadalajara, and Florence Hoffman, a Jewish American mother. After earning degrees from UC Berkeley, Columbia, and the University of New Mexico, he began his career as a history professor at UC Riverside in 1968 and has since become one of the most influential voices in American diversity education.",
    "personal_background": "In 1933, Carlos Cortés's father, a Mexican Catholic immigrant from Guadalajara, married Florence Hoffman, a Jewish American woman—an intermarriage before its time. Growing up in post-WWII Kansas City, young Carlos learned to navigate multiple identities. A defining moment came in 1949 when, as a sophomore, he was pressured by a Spanish teacher to go by 'Carl' instead of Carlos. His father stormed to the principal's office declaring: 'My son's name is Carlos. His father's name is Carlos. His grandfather's name was Carlos. His great-grandfather's name was Carlos. And I'll be damned if you're going to call him anything but Carlos.' This became a touchstone for authentic inclusivity throughout his career. He later wrote about these experiences in his memoir 'Rose Hill: An Intermarriage before Its Time' (2012) and adapted it into a one-person play performed nationwide.",
